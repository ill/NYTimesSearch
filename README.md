# Project 2 - *NYTimesSearch*

**NYTimesSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [ ] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [ ] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results
* [ ] For different news articles that only have text or only have images, use [Heterogenous Layouts](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView
* [ ] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [ ] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [ ] Uses [retrolambda expressions](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Lambda-Expressions) to cleanup event handling blocks.
* [ ] Leverages the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [ ] Leverages the [Retrofit networking library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) to access the New York Times API.
* [ ] Replace the embedded `WebView` with [Chrome Custom Tabs](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Chrome-Custom-Tabs) using a custom action button for sharing. (_**2 points**_)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Made the query filter have some nice styling in the UI.  I added some dividers and made the UI of the filter look somewhat nice in general.
I also tweaked the main menu to have the search bar to the left of a settings button for the query filter instead of leaving the query filter button under the ... menu.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One issue was figuring out if the q parameter can be used independently of the fq parameter.  I had to experiment with the swagger API to figure out if I needed to manually build a more complicated fq query that searched for articles using the search query in addition to the news desk value parameters I was passing in.  It also wasn't immediately obvious where the date format for begin_date was documented.  I finally found it eventually as YYYYMMDD.  It was a label next to the begin_date parameter in the swagger the whole time.

There was also a point where my simulator was in a state where it couldn't access the internet so I was stuck trying to figure out why nothing was returned from the API.  I looked at the project FAQ and simply restarting the simulator helped LOL.

Infinite paging had some challenges.  I started running into rate limiting errors and decided to add a delay between paging calls.  I then checked the FAQ for hints and saw that this was in fact the suggested way to fix the problem, so that was validating.  I still had to tweak the logic of paging and delays some more to get it stable.  It kept getting stuck for a while not loading more pages.  I have finally gotten it into a state where it no longer stops loading pages randomly even if more pages should be present.
